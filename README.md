# Register and Bus Lane Data Transfer
This project demonstrates the mechanism of how a register interacts with bus lanes by receiving data, storing it and transmitting it back when requested by other process.
Components Used:
1. 7805 Voltage Regulator: Ensures a stable 5V DC supply to power the circuit.
2. 555 Timer: Configured to generate a clock signal for synchronous operations
3. 74245 Transceiver: Facilitates bi-directional data transfer between the register and the bus lanes.
4. 74173 (4 x D Flip-Flops): Functions as the register to store and transfer data.
